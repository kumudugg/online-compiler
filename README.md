<h3>A simple web application made by flask for run C, Python and SQL codes</h3>

<p>This is my final project for CS50</p>

<h4>Note: </h4>
<ul>
    <li>You need to have python, gcc and sqlite3 installed. Cause I didn't include these. If I did, the size would be much larger</li>
    <li>You need to have flask installed</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to run:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>run app.py using Flask</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to use:</h4>
<p>After you run this using flask, Take upper given language and enter your code. It will output the result in below output box.</p>
<p>Also, If you registered, You can save code snippets by simply pressing save button. You can view these saved code by visiting snipptes in top-right nav bar</p>
<p>And you can delete these saved snipptes buy pressing delete button.</p>

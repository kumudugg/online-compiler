## A simple web application made by flask for run C, Python and SQL codes

This is my final project for CS50

### Note:
    - You need to have python, gcc and sqlite3 installed. Cause I didn't include these. If I did, the size would be much larger
    - You need to have flask installed


### How to run:
    - run app.py using Flask


### How to use:
    - After you run this using flask, Take upper given language and enter your code. It will output the result in below output box.
    - Also, If you registered, You can save code snippets by simply pressing save button. You can view these saved code by visiting snipptes in top-right nav bar
    - And you can delete these saved snipptes buy pressing delete button.
    

That's it.
